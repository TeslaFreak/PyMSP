	Making sure serial monitor thread starts and stops
v0.0.2
	ADD serial port connection functionality
	ADD responses: dictionary of {command, MSPResponse} to keep track of data for a given command's response as well as a flag (finished) to notify when the data has arrived
	ADD responsesTimeout: seconds to wait for a response before giving up
	ADD _sendCommand: sends a command and optional data (adds new item to responses dictionary)
	ADD _waitForResponse: waits for a response for a given command (keeps checking responses dictionary for finished=true)
	ADD _sendAndWait: calls _sendCommand and then _waitForResponse
	ADD _processCommand: adds (or updates) the data for the specified command and sets finished=true
v0.0.3
	ADD __del__: stop the thread and close the serial port when object is deleted
	ADD _toInt16: convert two bytes (bytearray) to a signed word
	ADD _toUInt16: convert two bytes (bytearray) to an unsigned word
	add _toInt32: convert four bytes (bytearray) to a dword
	ADD _toUInt32: convert four bytes (bytearray) to an unsigned dword
	ADD _fromInt16: convert a signed word to two bytes
	ADD _fromUInt16: convert an unsigned word to two bytes
	ADD _fromInt32: convert a signed dword to two bytes
	ADD _fromUInt32: convert an unsigned dword to two bytes
	ADD getAttitude: returns three-axis attitude information
	ADD getIMU: returns raw motion data (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetrometer); some of these may be zero if there isn't such a sensor installed
	ADD getRC: returns RC data (pitch, roll, yaw, throttle, and aux channels)
	ADD getAnalog: returns analog sensor data (battery, rssi)
	ADD getAltitude: returns estimated altitude and vertical speed (only available with an appropriate sensor)
	ADD setRC: set new RC values
	ADD setThrottle: set only throttle to new value
	ADD setAux: set specified Aux channel to new value
v0.0.4
	ADD setHeading: set the follow-heading (not sure what it does...)
	ADD getGPS: get GPS coordinates and other data
	ADD getStatus: get general flight controller status information
